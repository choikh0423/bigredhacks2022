## Inspiration
After living on-campus for the first two years of Cornell, it can be a daunting task for students to look for off-campus housing. In order to facilitate this process, we created a website that accumulates information about all of the off-campus housing in Cornell!

## What it does
Without having to send out a bunch of emails and visit leasing offices, IthacaAPTS.fyi  allows Cornell students to view off-campus housing related information. Current and previous tenants can upload pricing information and reviews from their off-campus living experience, and IthacaAPTS.fyi gathers and organizes the data for students to refer to when looking for housing.

## How we built it
